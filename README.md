For this project, I perfomed a simple exploratory data analysis on an e-commerce dataset to analyze item popularity, sales trends, and customer behavior.
Steps Performed: Data cleaning, Visualization, and many more.
The business insights are- Belt is the most purchased item (90), while Sun Hat is the least purchased item (50).
Tunic has the highest average purchase amount, while Sunglesses have the lowest average purchase amount.
Lastly, comapred to cash transactions, credit cards are the more favored mode of payment.
